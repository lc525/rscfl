   * High level summary about resourceful collected data:
   *
   * Resourceful collects per-system call resource consumption information.
   * Such information comes back from the rscfl kernel module in 3 connected
   * data structures: struct accounting, subsys_accounting and subsys_idx_set.
   *
   * One measurement implies getting back one struct accounting and
   * a (variable) number of struct subsys_accounting, indexed for simple access
   * by subsys_idx_set.
   *
   * Every time the API reads accounting data for a system call, it will get
   * back an accounting data structure. The pair (rscfl_handle, accounting)
   * uniquely identifies _one_ measurement. However, in itself, struct
   * accounting is just a handle: it contains very little useful data (for
   * example, the rc member variable will show whether any errors were
   * encountered kernel-side for that measurement, and nr_subsystems will
   * let the application know how many kernel subsystems were touched by the
   * measured system call).
   *
   * Besides those, one should not work with other members of
   * struct accounting directly. Instead, the high-level API contains functions
   * that will extract the actual measurements identified by one struct
   * accounting.
   *
   * The data structure containing the actual measurements inside one kernel
   * subsystem (Network, VFS, Block devices, etc) is subsys_accounting. One
   * system call can touch multiple such subsystems during its execution. The
   * set of those per-subsystem measurements is indexed in a subsys_idx_set
   * structure, obtained by calling rscfl_get_subsys(rscfl_handle, accounting).
   *
   * Multiple measurements can be aggregated within the same subsys_idx_set
   * index: this is very much a set union operation: if a new measurement
   * contains data for subsystems which aren't already present in the
   * subsys_idx_set those will be added to the index. For subsystems
   * that are already present in the index,
   */

  /*
   * Step 2 (optional): Define an aggegator
   *
   * This one is large enough to aggregate data across multiple system calls,
   * for 7 subsystems.
   *
   * The application _owns_ the data in the subsys_idx_set pointer that is
   * returned, and will need to free it using free_subsys_idx_set(agg)

   * Depending on the frequency of other accounted syscalls that happen before
