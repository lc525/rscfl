/* Per-CPU (pid -> accounting buf) hash table pid_to_acct_tbl
 *
 * We allocate one hash table per CPU in order to hold (pid, accounting*) pairs
 * for processes (pids) that do resource accounting and are active (or have
 * previously run) on that CPU but have not terminated.
 *
 * The key of the per-cpu hashtable is a process pid (pid_t)
 * The value of the per-cpu hashtable is a struct pid_acct
 *
 * The hashtable is maintained accurate by interposing scheduler actions
 * (i.e when a process migrates from one cpu to another, table entries
 * are also copied across corresponding cpu hash tables).
 *
 * As scheduler operations are done with preemption disabled, we can typically
 * access the per-cpu hash tables directly using the CPU_TBL macro defined in
 * hasht.h
 *
 * INSERTION example:
 *
 *   pid_acct* pa = (pid_acct *)kmalloc(sizeof(pid_acct), GFP_ATOMIC);
 *   pa->pid = current->pid;
 *   hash_add(CPU_TBL(pid_acct_tbl), &pa->link[cpu_id], pa->pid);
 *
 * LOOKUP example (iterate through all elements in a hash bucket):
 *
 *    pid_acct *it;
 *    hash_for_each_possible(CPU_TBL(pid_acct_tbl), it, link[cpu_id], key)
 *      if(it->pid == key)
 *        //do stuff with pid_acct *it
