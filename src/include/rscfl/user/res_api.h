/**
 * Usage example (for brevity, we skip the code checking for errors after each
 * API call):
 *
 * First, call rscfl_init(). a separate call is needed for each application
 * thread - it allocates two shared memory regions between user and kernel
 * space: one that holds resource accounting data and a second for storing
 * measurement requests from the application:
 *
 * rhdl = rscfl_init();
 *
 * The rscfl_handle you get back will be needed in all subsequent API calls on
 * that thread.
 *
 * Now, declare interest in measuring the resource consumption of the next
 * syscall by calling rscfl_acct_next:
 *
 * int err = rscfl_acct_next(rhdl);
 * int fd = open("/../file_path", O_CREAT); // syscall being measured
 * ...
 *
 * You can then call rscfl_acct_read, and obtain the struct accounting object
 * that holds an index of all the resource consumption data for your syscall:
 *
 * struct accounting acct_hdl;
 * err = rscfl_read_acct(rhdl, &acct_hdl);
 *
 * The pair (rhdl, acct_hdl) uniquely identifies this particular measurement.
 * To get access to the measured resource consumption data, call one of the
 * high-level API functions. As a simple example, being interested only in this
 * particular call (no aggregation), we can call rscfl_get_subsys:
 *
 * subsys_idx_set *open_subsys_measurements;
 * open_subsys_measurements = rscfl_get_subsys(rhdl, &acct_hdl);
 *
 * The returned structure contains an index of all the kernel subsystems
 * touched during the open call (the idx data member).
 *
 * If idx[i] = -1 then subsystem i was not touched.
 * On the other hand, if idx[i] = val (val!=-1) then you can read the
 * corresponding measured data from set[val] (look at the definition of
 * struct subsys_accounting in costs.h to see what data is available)
 *
 * TODO(lc525): write documentation for the aggregation functions and the
 * advanced API
